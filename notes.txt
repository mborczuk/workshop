Inserting New Documents
- Using Atlas UI
	- Insert document button
	- Each MongoDB document has an _id field (unique)
		- Automatically populated with an ObjectId object
	- Data types on the side
	- Document fields (can include objects with their own fields in documents)
- Error: Inserting a document with a _id that already exists in the collection (duplicate key error)
	- Fix: use drop (remove from the collection before re-adding the doc)
	- Fix: change the _id field (delete so it gets regenerated)
- Using the mongo shell
	- findOne() - get a random document from the collection
	- insert() - add new doc to collection
Insert Multiple Documents
- use square bracketed list of documents
- add in the order listed in array
	- first, second, third, etc.
	- if second throws an error, third won't be added
	- ordered flag - set it to false and all documents that don't throw an error will be added
- if you insert into a collection or database that doesn't exist, it is created automatically
Updating Documents
- Atlas UI
	- Click the edit button
	- Modify object types and values
- Mongo Shell
	- updateOne(query, update) or updateMany(query, update)
	- Update operators
		- {"$inc": {"field": value}} - increment
		- {"$set": {"field": value}} - set
		- {"$push": {"field": value1, ...}} - push to array field

Deleting Documents
- Trash icon in Atlas UI
