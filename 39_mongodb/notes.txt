Aggregation Framework
- Grouping data
- Pipeline structure
- Bigger than the MQL itself
- $group: takes data, siphons it to reservoirs
	- Group by different fields
- Data is not changed
sort(), limit()
- sort by field value (specify in query)
- limit - get only a certain number of elements
Index
-  Create an index for later use based on data
- use createIndex()
Data Modeling
- Store data in the way it will be used
- MongoDB can easily shift data models
Upsert
- Updating requires locating
- If exists -> update, else -> insert a new document
