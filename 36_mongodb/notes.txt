How does MongoDB store data?
	- JSON
	- use key:value pairs
	- keys must be in quotes, file must start and end with curly braces
	- BSON - binary JSON
		- Faster
		- More data types
		- Stored in BSON instead of JSON
Import/Export
	- Can export/import in JSON or BSON
		- BSON is faster, but unreadable
		- JSON is slower, but easy to read
	- drop flag - prevent database errors
	- mongodump/mongorestore - BSON
	- mongoexport/mongoimport - JSON
Data Explorer
	- Collections > Data Explorer
	- Use namespaces
	- Can look for documents in the Find tab
		- Can see subdocuments as well
	- Can use JSON to make queries
Find Command
	- Query data from the shell
	- show dbs - show dbs in cluster
	- use - look at a specific db
	- db.<collection>.find(<query>)
	- .count() - how many there are
	- .pretty() - easier to read JSON
	- Mongo Shell is also a JS interpreter
