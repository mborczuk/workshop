- Need to set up key authentication on local machine
- ssh mikey@192.34.56.31
- You should NOT be able to ssh from the outside as root, instead create a user account with sudo perms
- Going to try killing my droplet and creating a new one to see how accurate my docs are
	- It worked!
- sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new-name> -- rename a droplet
