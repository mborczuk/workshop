Our Approach
We decided to split the problem into two parts: reading the csv file and
finding/printing the job. We decided to use csv module to construct our dictionary.
While creating this dictionary, we multiplied each percentage by 10, since each percentage
only went out to one decimal place. This allowed us to work with integers. To find the job,
we generated a random integer from 0 to 999 (inclusive), and then checked to see which of the ranges
we created (based on the probabilities) the integer fell into. This seems to work quite well!
'''
import csv
import random

num = 0

dict = {
}

with open('occupations.csv', mode ='r') as file:   
    
   # reading the CSV file
    csvFile = csv.DictReader(file)

   # add contents to dictionary, multiply by 10 to make working with the probabilities easier
    for lines in csvFile:
        dict[lines['Job Class']] = float(lines['Percentage']) * 10

# generate a random integer
num = random.randint(0, 999)
counter = 0
print(dict)
# adds to counter and once it passes the randomly generated number, it prints the key
for key in dict.keys():
    if counter + dict[key] > num:
        print(key)
        # exit loop once we've found our job
        break
    else:
        counter += dict[key]
        # continue to next iteration of loop so we don't print Jobless every time
        continue
    # if the random int doesn't fall within any range, there is no job to print
    print("Other Job")
