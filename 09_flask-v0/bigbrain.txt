Q0: It's similar to Java since you can set a variable to a value.
Q1: The / usually represents the home page of a website
Q2: It will probably print to the console. It will print details about the app.
Q3: It should appear on the page, hello_world() returns it, and then run() picks it up and uses it as text.
Q4: Similar to Java where you would have a name of a function and add .add or .get.

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION...

We discovered that it prints to the terminal, NOT the browser console.

Other notable Q/C/Cs: What is lazy loading? Warning message that probably doesn't mean much? (This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.) Debug mode is off, so what happens when it's on? What is production WSGI server?
