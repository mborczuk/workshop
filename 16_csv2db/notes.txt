K16, Using SQLite
2021-10-22

Code Explanation:  We first created a file discobandit.db, and connected
sqlite3 to it.  We then created two tables, one for the students and another
for the courses, and we used dict reader to open the file student_dict and
courses_dict into a collection of dictionaries.  From there, we inserted the
data into the tables that we created before.

Commands used:
create table <name> (<parameters>)
insert into <table_name> <parameter names>(<parameters>)
csv.DictReader(<file_name>)
.execute

Other notable commands:
Select <parameter> from <table_name>

Notable Notes:
For parameters when creating tables, need the type of parameter in all caps,
like TEXT and INTEGER.
For shell use, must use ";" at the end.
