- define data model after creating application
- Data Modeling:
	- Evaluate application load
		- Get data size, queries, indexes
		- Get operations
	- Map out entities + relationships
		- Linking
			- Types: 
				- One to one
				- One to many
				- Many to many
			- Data can be accessed through a different collection
		- Embedding
			- Data exists within an object
			- Useful if only one type of object is being queried
	- Finalize data model
		- Apply relevant design patterns
			- Different schemas (for old and new ways of representing the data)
			 	- Can specify which schema we want to use
				- Can also migrate data to new schema automatically upon query of data with an old schema
			- Bucket Pattern
				- Store small, related data items
			- Computing Pattern
				- Upon write, update count of ratings and sum of ratings
					- Don't need to recompute every single time you want an average
			- There are multiple design patterns!
- Your data model should fit your team
	- Smaller team = simpler database
